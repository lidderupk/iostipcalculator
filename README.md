# TipCalculator

TipCalculator is a very clean and simple tip calculating app. It takes the math out of the way ! It is built in ObjectiveC using MVC paradigm and uses XCTest framework for [unit tests](https://github.com/8indaas/iostipcalculator/blob/master/tipcalculatorTests/tipcalculatorTests.m).

The tipcalculator was built as part of the [Ios CodePath iOS Mobile Bootcamp](http://thecodepath.com/iosbootcamp). This simple calculator calculates the tip (10%, 15% or 20%) based on user selection. There is a settings page to store the default tip. The setting is applied immediately to the main screen<br/>
